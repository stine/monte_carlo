Problem: Estimate Pi Using the Monte Carlo Method 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method)


Write a program that estimates pi using the Monte Carlo method. There 
are multiple routes to solving this problem. A simple one uses plane 
geometry. Inscribe a circle within a square, select a number of points 
within the square, and compare the number of points within the circle to 
the number of points within the square. The ratio of the two counts 
estimates the ratio of the areas.
